![screenshot](screenshot.png)

This image uses:

- [`ipfs-cluster-ctl`] - Pin the site root to our IPFS Cluster
- [`entrypoint.sh`] - The script to tie it all together

## Requirements

The following environment variables should be set

```sh
CLUSTER_USER="<beep>"
CLUSTER_PASSWORD="<boop>"
GITHUB_TOKEN="<needs repo status scope>"
```

You can optionally overrider the following

```sh
# Multiaddr for the ipfs cluster to pin your site to
CLUSTER_HOST="/dnsaddr/cluster.ipfs.io"

# URL for the gateway to use for the site preview url
IPFS_GATEWAY="https://ipfs.io"
```
